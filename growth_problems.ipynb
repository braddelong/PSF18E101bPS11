    "The autograder, both in the tests you run along the way as you work on the problem set and in calculating the final score, looks in the same directory as the problem set notebook for an \"ok.tests\" directory, and then runs the tests in the \"q\\*\\*.py\" files in that directory (where \"\\*\\*\" denotes a two-digit number, possibly with a leading zero). Those tests take the form of comparing a variable that should be in your namespace and seeing if it is close to some desired value that we get when we do the problem set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus while the problem set instructions ask you to run simulations and plot graphs, what you are tested on is whether the appropriate variables in your namespace have (close to the) right values. We do not care what code you use in order to get those variables to the right values. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can run simulations and then pick appropriate values out by slicing a series in order to get the right number. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use your knowledge of the algebraic solution to the model to have Python calculate the answer, having first set the parameters to the right values, as in:\n",
    "\n",
    "    s = 0.24 # (say)\n",

    "    KoverYalternative = s/(n+Delta_n+g+delta)\n",

    "    KoverYinitial = 4\n",
    "    KoverYalternative = 4.8\n",
    "    \n",
    "Perhaps we should ask you to do all three—start with simulations, or with algebraic equations with set parameter values, or with full pen-and-paper calculations with only the final results entered into the notebook—and then ask you to check your results from one mode by doing the other two. But: _ars longa, vita brevis_. Focus on what works _for you_: the key is to get a sense of how economists' center-of-gravity analyses of long-run growth work, so that when you encounter such an analysis later, outside the university, you have the right intellectual panoply to evaluate it.\n",

But if you don't, sooner or later the machine's namespace will get confused, and then you will get confused about the state of the machine's namespace, and by assuming things about it that are false you will lose hours and hours...   \n",

    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Do** exercise agile development practices: if there is a line of code that you have not tested, test it. The best way to test is to ask the machine to echo back to you the thing you have just created in its namespace to make sure that it is what you want it to be. Only after you are **certain** that your namespace contains what you think it does should you write the next line of code. And then you should immediately test it...   \n",

    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Do not** confuse assignment (\"=\") and test for equality (\"==\"). In general, if there is an \"if\" anywhere nearby, you should be testing for equality. If there is not, you should be assignment a variable in your namespace to a value. **Do** curse the mathematicians 500 years ago who did not realize that in the twenty-first century it would be very convenient if we had different and not confusable symbols for equals-as-assignment and equals-as-test...   \n",

    "\n",
    "The bare Solow growth model does not do a good job of accounting for this \"Divergence, Big Time\". With the standard estimate of the production function parameter $ \\alpha = 1/3 $ and with the presumption that the efficiency of labor E is principally determined by ideas about technology and organization that can be easily communicated and learned, the underlying bias of the Solow growth model is toward one of anticipating relatively rapid economic convergence to Global North productivity levels. That has not happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem set has indicated two modifications to the Solow model that have some promise for explaining some of the \"Divergence, Big Time\" that characterizes our world: the demographic burdens placed on emerging markets that are still undergoing pre-Demographic Transition rapid population growth, and the association of a high efficiency of labor with a relative price structure that makes boosting productivity through investment easy.\n",
